A proposal for a Web Application to fulfill the term project course requirement
This is your Big Idea - eventually it will be implemented as an ASP.NET Core MVC web application and will serve mainly as a proof of concept that you can take the mechanical concepts that we are studying in the course with the Dykstra tutorials and apply them to a parallel development for some idea you supply

I will work alone and making a Website for DogTraining/DogShopping website. 
the website will be able to do shopping cart, database list of graduated dog as well as calculating stock if it still avaliable. 


Your proposal should include the following details for this deliverable:
An application name - your name should be logical, marketable, and catchy and hopefully even follow all best practice identifier rules 
The name of Application will be : "Lucky Big Paw"

The names of the DbSet<> objects that you intend to have in your DbContext class
This is a list of entities (db tables) that your web application will manipulate using the Entity Framework
A minimum of 2 are required. More than 2 is better but don't try to artificially impose extra DbSet<> objects over what your application "naturally" needs
Do not count the users or user accounts that may be established as part of your web app's DbContext. MVC and EF will treat the identity components (users and accounts) as a separate context.

The Database set that will be in this application that I can think of right now is
1. Stock Database
2. Graduated dog database
3. Shopping cart database.
